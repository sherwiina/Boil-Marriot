# Boil-Marriot
The program creates a particle moving with specified velocity in a 2D rectangular box with using various class of functions and subroutines to track its path through the box colliding with the specified walls.
Furtherly with adding more particles by the user as an input, one can investigate Boyle's law comparing output number that is the number of collision to the walls in each case as a result of more pressure in this 2D box.
